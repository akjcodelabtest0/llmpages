# My GitHub Pages Showcase

This repository hosts a simple web application deployed on GitHub Pages, showcasing a collection of diverse files as requested. The `index.html` serves as a central hub, providing explanations and links to each individual file, demonstrating various content types and fulfilling specific prompts.

## Project Structure

The project is designed to be straightforward and self-contained:

- `index.html`: The main landing page, built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness. It lists and describes all other generated files with direct links.
- `ashravan.txt`: A fictional short story, approximately 300-400 words, set in the Brandon Sanderson universe. It delves into Ashravan's character after Shai's restoration, culminating in a dramatic climax.
- `dilemma.json`: A JSON file presenting an ethical dilemma for an autonomous vehicle, exploring two distinct scenarios with reasoned responses.
- `about.md`: A simple Markdown file containing a three-word self-description.
- `pelican.svg`: An SVG image illustrating a whimsical scene of a pelican riding a bicycle.
- `restaurant.json`: A JSON file recommending a specific restaurant in Bangalore, complete with geographical coordinates and a dish recommendation.
- `prediction.json`: A JSON file containing a prediction for the Federal Funds rate by December 2025 (as a float between 0-1), accompanied by a brief explanation.
- `uid.txt`: A plain text file containing a unique identifier, included as-is.
- `LICENSE`: The full text of the MIT License, governing the usage and distribution of this project.

## Features
